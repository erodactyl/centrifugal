Root {
  posts
}

Post {
  details: Signed<{
    text
    time
  }>
  sender:
  replies: Post[]
  likes: User[]
}

User {
  alias
}

Flows: 
1. User A writes a text, signs it, puts an :id (timestamp), and adds it to the "posts" path
2. User B writes a text, signs it, puts an id (timestamp) and add it to the "posts/:id/replies" path as a reply to the previous post
3. User B signs their alias and sets it under "posts/:id/likes" path

Vulnerability check:
User X is an exploier. They want to
1. Change a post text - can't do, as it is signed by the sender (Can possibly delete the text field and put their own, needs checking)
2. Change a post sender - can't do, as it is signed by the sender (Same as above)
3. Add infinite likes - can't do, likes have a signed alias in them
